ABC Supermarket is a major player in UK, running multiple stores. They run a huge loyalty program with 250,000 participants. They has recently launched a new line of organic products and they wish to have a fast market penetration for these products, for which they plan to run an analytics enabled marketing campaign targeting their loyalty base first. They have already given free sample kits to around 10% of their loyalty program participants and recorded their purchase decision. For the remaining 90%, they plan to run their marketing campaign only on the most probable buyers.

They have shared data for the 10%, having the individualâ€™s demographic plus loyalty program details, along with their purchase decision. They want to formulate an analytics enabled marketing strategy to target the most probable buyers from the remaining 90%. With the objective of optimising profitability, keeping an eye on market penetration, given revenue from a successful buyer is 146.1 pounds, the cost of promotional sample kit is 43.05 pounds.
